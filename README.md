[The Early Novels Database](https://earlynovels.github.io/) (END) "generates high-quality metadata about novels published between 1660
 and 1850 in order to make early works of fiction more available to both traditional and computational modes of humanistic study." 
 The visualizations found in this repository utilizes a 1700-1790 subset of this metadata to computationally explore 
 connections between the early novel and any epigraphs within. The connectingLines' design was inspired by the open-source 
 [HBO Recycling Program](http://zgrossbart.github.io/hborecycling) visualization. The bubbleChart was modified from a 
 [Block](https://bl.ocks.org/john-guerra/0d81ccfd24578d5d563c55e785b3b40a).
